This little tool is written in lazarus 1.4.4 and does provide you a simple conversion between a browser and teamviewer. You can specify an url in the format teamviewer://ID[:PASSWORD] and teamviewer will open. How does it work? Just put the "project1.exe" (rename it if you want to) into a folder where you do not delete this file. Afterwards just double click on it and press the upper button (the other button will delete the registry settings). Search you teamviewer.exe and you're ready!

If you use this tool it would be great if you can inform me about any changes (maybe pull request). If you translated this tool into another language please let me know, too.

Feel free to do whatever you want to with it!
